## Project Descriptions
### Digital Clock
This project creates a digital clock using Python's tkinter library. The clock updates in real-time and displays hours, minutes, and seconds.

### Google Translator
This project uses the googletrans library to translate text between various languages. The user inputs text and selects the target language for translation.

### Internet Speed Project
A Python script that uses the speedtest-cli library to check and display your internet connection's download and upload speeds.

### QR Code Generator
This project generates QR codes for any given text or URL using the qrcode library. The generated QR code can be saved as an image file.

### Shutdown and Restart
These scripts automate the process of shutting down or restarting your computer. They can be executed directly from the command line.

### Typing Speed Test
This project measures how fast you can type a given text. It calculates your words per minute (WPM) and provides feedback on your typing speed.

### Validate E-mail
A simple script that checks if an email address is valid using regular expressions. It ensures that the email follows standard formatting rules.
